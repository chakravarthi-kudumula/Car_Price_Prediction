<h1>Car Price Prediction Project</h1>

<h4>Overview</h4>

<p>This project focuses on predicting car prices based on various features using machine learning techniques. It utilizes a dataset containing information about cars, including their selling prices, year of manufacture, present price, kilometers driven, fuel type, seller type, transmission type, and ownership history. The project employs Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn for data manipulation, visualization, model training, and evaluation.</p>

<h3>Dataset</h3>

<p>The dataset used in this project contains information about cars, including the following columns:</p>

<p>Car_Name</p>
<p>Year</p>
<p>Selling_Price</p>
<p>Present_Price</p>
<p>Kms_Driven</p>

<h3>Project Structure</h3>

<p>The project structure is organized as follows:</p>

<p>**car_price_prediction.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.</p>
<p>**car data.csv**: Dataset used for training and testing the models.</p>
<p>**README.md**: Markdown file containing project documentation.</p>

<h3>Technical Details:</h3>
<h6></h6>Data Preprocessing:</
<p>The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.</p>
<p>Initial exploration of the data includes checking for missing values, data types, and basic statistics.</p>
<p>Categorical variables are encoded using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding to convert them into a numerical format suitable for modeling.</p>
<p>Feature scaling may be applied to standardize or normalize numerical features to ensure all features contribute equally to the model training process.</p>
<h6>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):</h6>
<p>Visualizations such as histograms, box plots, and scatter plots are used to understand the distribution of features, identify outliers, and explore relationships between variables.</p>
<p>Correlation analysis helps identify the strength and direction of linear relationships between numerical variables and the target variable (selling price).</p>
<h6>Model Building:</h6>
<p>The dataset is split into training and testing sets using train_test_split() from Scikit-learn.</p>
<p>Linear Regression and Lasso Regression models are chosen for prediction due to their simplicity and interpretability.</p>
<p>The models are trained on the training set using the fit() method.</p>
<p>Hyperparameter tuning may be performed using techniques like cross-validation to optimize model performance.</p>
<h6>Model Evaluation:</h6>
<p>The trained models are evaluated on the test set using evaluation metrics such as R-squared error, mean squared error (MSE), and mean absolute error (MAE).</p>
<p>Visualizations like scatter plots of actual vs. predicted prices help assess the model's predictive performance and identify any patterns or trends.</p>
<h6>Prediction and Deployment:</h6>
<p>Once the models are trained and evaluated, they can be used to make predictions on new or unseen data.</p>
<p>The deployed model can be integrated into applications or systems where users can input relevant features, and the model outputs the predicted selling price of the car.</p>

<h6>Technical Challenges and Considerations:</h6>
<p>**Feature Engineering**: Identifying and engineering relevant features that have a significant impact on the target variable.</p>
<p>**Model Selection**: Choosing the appropriate regression model based on the dataset characteristics, assumptions, and requirements.</p>
<p>**Data Leakage**: Ensuring that no information from the test set leaks into the training process, which could artificially inflate model performance.</p>
<p>**Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing model hyperparameters to improve predictive accuracy and generalization performance.</p>

<h3>Results</h3>

<p>The project achieves a certain level of accuracy in predicting car prices based on the features provided.</p>
<p>Evaluation metrics such as R-squared error are used to assess model performance.</p>
<p>Visualizations are provided to understand the relationships between different features and the target variable.</p>

<h6>Future Improvements</h6>

<p>Incorporate more advanced machine learning techniques such as ensemble methods or neural networks for potentially better predictions.</p>
<p>Explore additional features or datasets to improve model accuracy and robustness.</p>
<p>Optimize hyperparameters of the models to enhance perfomance further.</p>
